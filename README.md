# Automatic Smart Slider
###  * Super Easy-to-Use <br> * Super Fast & Super lightweight <br>  * Pure HTML CSS JS <br> * Totally Responsive <br> * Not Depended on The Number of Images

Free Smart Slider - Auto JS Generator ( Pure HTML / CSS / JS )

My biggest problem with other sliders was that I had to change a lot of codes if I wanted to change number of images <br>
But now with this slider you just need to add your images with ``` <img> ``` HTML tag and this smart slider will do the rest for you automatically. <br>
This is developed by myself from scratch. I wrote it grand-up to use it for all of my future projects.  <br>
You can use it too, for free! <br>

*** Replace arx_slider.js file with the other one in case you don't need the caption generator ***
